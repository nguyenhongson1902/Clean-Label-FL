# Tutorial

## 1. Understanding the codebase

### 1.1. The `client.py` file

This file contains the code for the client. It is responsible for sending the
requests to the server and receiving the responses. It is also responsible for
the user interface.

### 1.2. The `server.py` file

This file contains the code for the server. It is responsible for receiving the
requests from the client and sending the responses. It is also responsible for
the database.

### 1.3. The `engines.py` file

This file contains the code for the engines. It is responsible for the
processing of the requests and the generation of the responses.

### 1.4. The `strategies.py` file

This file contains the code for the strategies. It is responsible for the
generation of the responses.

## 2. Requirements

- Get datasets, and then loaders (distributed iid or non-iid). Save loaders to 
files (nessesary to run server and clients)

- Explain some main arguments in the code

- Run server.py at the current directory ./

- Run run.sh in ./run (before that, change the file mode to executable)
